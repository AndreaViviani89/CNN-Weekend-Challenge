# Intel Image Classification
This project is about creating a cnn model able to classify an image into one of the following categories:  
* Buildings  
* Forest  
* Glacier
* Mountain
* Sea
* Street
 
Details about the dataset used can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/puneet6060/intel-image-classification).  
We built a streamlit app that, given an image (drag and drop), tells you to which from the above categories the image belongs too.  
Additionally, the app can receive a folder of mixed images, creates subfolders into which to classify the images.

# Requirements
* streamlit
* pytorch
* torchvision
* Pillow
* os
* shutil

# How to use the app
1) Single image classification
2) Multiple images classification
